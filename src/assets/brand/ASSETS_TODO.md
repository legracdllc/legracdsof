# Brand Assets (TODO)

The following files were specified to be copied into `src/assets/brand/`, but were not found on this machine under the provided `/mnt/data/...` paths (not present on Windows).

Placeholders have been created for the exact filenames required by the spec (so the repo is complete on Day 1).

If you have the original assets, replace the placeholder files in this folder with the originals:

## Status

- If these files look identical, that is expected: the placeholders are currently copies of `brand-logo-primary.png`.
- The UI uses `brand-logo-primary.png` and other named brand files directly; the UUID filenames exist to match the spec.
